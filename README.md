# Py-Portofolio-BJR

Here I upload the code for the problems that I successfully tackled on the ROSALIND.info platform.

Please leave me a message if you have any suggestions on how I can improve my code.

Here's my progress on the platform: http://rosalind.info/users/bjralexandru/ 

Thank you for visiting this repository and I hope you have a great day!

LE: accidentally deleted the entire repository back when I was learning git. I found a copy of the entire folder on an older HDD and re-uploaded them (That's what 'Delted' comes from).
